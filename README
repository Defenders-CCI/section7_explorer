A basic app for viewing, slicing, and dicing FWS section 7 consultation data.

Section 7 of the US Endangered Species Act directs federal agencies to use their authority to help conserve listed species. One way they do this is by consulting with the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service to ensure the agency's action won't jeopardize the continued existence of a species, or destroy the species critical habitat. Many myths surround section 7 consultations; we got data on all consultations recorded by FWS since 2008 and analyzed it. The results have just been released in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/12/01/1516938112), but because communicating results with broader audiences is a key component of improving policy implementation, we also made this Shiny app (which can be found at http://www.defenders.org/section-7). We plan to update the data and the app on a regular basis and appreciate feedback that can improve either the code or the user experience.
